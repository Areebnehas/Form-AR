# Project Intake Form

This project is an intake form I've created! It's designed to collect all the important details about a project, like the project type, number of consultants, their specializations, and the project timeline. It's got some stylish checkered borders and smooth drop-down menus, and it's responsive, so it looks great on any screen size.

## Features

- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various screen sizes
- Stylish checkered borders and smooth drop-down menus
